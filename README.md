# GA-FJSP
Genetic algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem

# Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP)
The Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP) is an extension of the classical job shop scheduling problem which allows an operation to be processed by any machine from a given set. The problem is to assign each operation to a machine and to order the operations on the machines, such that the maximal completion time (makespan) of all operations is minimized.

# Files
The Dataset.xlsx file contains the input files for the problem
The FJSP.py file contain the code implementing a GA for solving the problem. The package DEAP was used.
